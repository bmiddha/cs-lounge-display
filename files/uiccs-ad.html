New CS Advisors!<br>
<br>
Hi, I'm Bryant Hill and I am looking forward to helping you create a path here at UIC! I was born and raised in Chicago and went to college at the University of Missouri and have degrees in Communication and Film Studies. This is actually my second position I have had here at UIC, previously worked in graduate admissions, but before I worked in Sports Broadcasting with ESPN, SEC Network, and Major League Baseball. When I was a student I decided to transfer schools then later change majors, so it is my goal to connect each student with the resources to take ownership of their college career in the same way that I did. I am excited to do that with Computer Science students at UIC so come stop by the office at SEO 919 for anything you might need.<br>

Hi. I am Joshua Taylor and I'm very excited to be part of the computer science department! I was born and raised in Chicago, and graduated from Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Before UIC, I worked in the banking industry in wealth management. I desired to work in a creative, energetic, and productive environment, where I could actually help others reach their aspirations. UIC is an amazing institution, and Iâ€™m ready to help CS students on their academic journey to graduation. Stop by and say hi at SEO 919 and get to know your academic advisors!<br>
