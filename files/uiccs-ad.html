Hi, I'm Bryant Hill and I am excited to help you down your path here at UIC! I was born and raised in Chicago and went to college at the University of Missouri and have degrees in Communication and Film Studies. Before UIC I worked in Career Advising as well as Sports Broadcasting. I was a student who decided to transfer schools then later change majors, so it is my goal to support students as they take ownership of their college career in the same way that I did. So come stop by the office at SEO 919 for anything you might need!<br>
